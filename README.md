**What is Spring Batch?**

**Spring Batch** is a framework provided by Spring to support the development of batch processing applications. Batch processing refers to the execution of large volumes of data in chunks, typically where tasks are executed sequentially or in parallel. It is specifically used for jobs like reading from a database, processing data, and writing it to another database or file system in a reliable and efficient manner. The Spring Batch framework provides robust features to handle large datasets, including:

**Chunk-based processing**: Breaking large data into chunks to manage memory effectively.
**Job and step management**: Defining and managing jobs and their execution steps.
**Error handling and recovery**: Includes features to handle failures and restart jobs from a specific point.
**Transaction management**: Ensures data consistency by using transactions to commit data changes.
